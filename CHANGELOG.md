## v2.2: CHMU Support / Userspace CLI Tool

**1. CXL Hotness Monitoring Unit Support (CXL 3.2.8.2.8)**
- The CXL Hotness Monitoring Unit (CHMU) is an interface that allows software running on CXL hosts to identify the ‘hot’ memory ranges (i.e., memory ranges with higher access frequency relative to other memory ranges) in CXL memory devices in terms of memory access counts.
- Added a CXL device driver to support CHMU and an emulation function based on QEMU.

**2. CXL-CLI**
- Baseline v79 → v80

**3. Bug Fix**
- Fix for memory leak issue occuring when setting the 'use_auto_arena_scaling' allocator option to 'false'.
- When 'use_auto_arena_scaling option' is set to false, the number of arenas is 1 per pool.
- When 'true', the arena is generated in proportion to the number of CPUs as before.

## v1.5.1: SMDK on QEMU

**Support SMDK on QEMU**

- QEMU supports CXL type3 volatile device since about v8.1.0.
Reflecting the requirement out of CXL industry researchers, SMDK supports QEMU emulation since v1.5.1.
The version allows using userspace plugins(library, cli, BM, testcases) and OS interfaces(swap and cache) on the QEMU v8.1.50 included.
Please refer to https://github.com/OpenMPDK/SMDK/wiki/4.-Kernel#427-qemu to understand how to emulate CXL memory and SMDK on top of the QEMU.

- Limitation
group-noop is only supported on QEMU among three grouping functions - group-zone, group-node, and group-noop.
MLC BW tool and PMU related SW are not working on QEMU due to the CPU emulation.


**1. Kernel**
- Patch on v6.4

**2. QEMU**
- QEMU v8.1.50 and launcher scripts

**3. Documentation**
- Kernel Guide (updated) : https://github.com/OpenMPDK/SMDK/wiki/4.-Kernel#427-qemu <br>

<br>

## v1.5: Intelligent Tiering Engine / Userspace CLI Tool / Kernel (update)

**1. Intelligent Tiering Engine**

- SMDK v1.5 supports a new DDR/CXL memory tiering scenario, *adaptive interleaving*, by expanding the Intelligent Tiering Engine.
This is a DDR/CXL memory interleaving in a software manner to lead to an effective bandwidth aggregation of DDR/CXL memories.
While it works, *adaptive interleaving* maintains the maximum bandwidth map of online numa-nodes, keeping track of in-use bandwidth of a node.
When the bandwidth saturation of a node is detected, it handles incoming allocation request from other memory nodes in an autonomous way.
This is geared to mitigate imbalanced memory utilization of DDR/CXL memory without an user intervention.


**2. CXL-CLI**

- CXL Spec commands
> Added: get shutdown state, set shutdown state, get scan media capabilities, scan media, get scan media results, sanitize <br>
> Deprecated: get poison list


**3. Kernel**

- Baseline v6.0-rc6 -> v6.4

## v1.4: CXL-Cache / Userspace CLI Tool (update)

### This update reflects the voices of Industry partners who cooperate with us.

**1. CXL Cache**
- In addition to the usecase that uses CXL device as **System RAM** and **Swap** interfaces, SMDK v1.4 allows another usecase that uses CXL device as **OS-Level Cache** interface. 
- CXL Cache is the 2nd-level page cache with pluggable and page-granularity attributes that stores clean file-backed pages. 
Upon CXL Cache, a file-backed page is traversed in following memory order - pagecache(near), cxlcache(far), disk(farthest).


<br>

**2. CXL-CLI**
- CXL Spec commands added
> identify, get-health-info, set-alert-config, get-alert-config, get-firmware-info, transfer-firmware, activate-firmware
- CXL Cache control commands added
> enable-cxlcache, disable-cxlcache, flush-cxlcache, check-cxlcache

<br>

<br>


## v1.3: CXL-Swap / CXL Composability / Userspace CLI Tool (update)

### This update reflects the voices of Industry partners who cooperate with us.

**1. CXL Swap**
- In addition to the usecase that uses CXL device as **System RAM** interface,
SMDK v1.3 allows another usecase that uses CXL device as **Swap interface**.  CXL Swap implements Linux *frontswap* and is delivered as kernel module likewise *zSwap*.
- However, it does not perform (de)compression while page swapping, thus, leads to CPU saving and latency QoS on swap handling. We believe it is more close to the philosophy of CXL memory expansion.

<br>

**2. CXL Composability**
- Composability is also a primary matter of CXL philosophy. By adopting previous Linux patches and algorithms, we enhanced compatibility and coverage of Linux VMM belows to better support of CXL composability.
- Page migration - manage CXL DRAM as *movable* page attribute
- Memory node on/offline -  allow memory-node on/offline function for CXL DRAM
- Fragmentation avoidance - apply the algorithm for avoiding DRAM fragmentation issue to CXL DRAM

<br>

**3. CXL-CLI**
- CXL Swap control commands
> enable_cxlswap, disable_cxlswap, flush_cxlswap, check_cxlswap
- CXL Device performance reporter
> get-latency-matrix

<br>

**4. Documentation**

## v1.2: N-way Grouping / Userspace CLI Tool / Application Compatibility

### This update reflects the voices of Industry partners who cooperate with us.

**1. N-way grouping (a.k.a memory partition)**

    - Related Usecase : Memory Interleaving, Isolation, Virtualization
- CXL-CLI - group / node management
- SMDK Allocator - updated compatible / optimization library
- SMDK Kernel - primitive interfaces to provide online and static CXL device information, and control

<br>

**2. CXL-CLI**
- Grouping commands
> N-way group : group-zone / group-node / group-noop / group-dax / group-add / group-remove <br>
> Listing group : group-list
- CXL Spec commands
> Poison : inject-poison / get-poison / clear-poison <br>
> Timestamp : set-timestamp / get-timestamp <br>
> Event : get-event-record / clear-event-record
- Basic CXL-CLI commands
> SMDK CXL-CLI is an expansion of Intel CXL-CLI

<br>

**3. Application Compatibility**
- A multi-node traversal application is now able to run normally. e.g.) MLC

<br>

**4. Miscellaneous**
 - Error/Exception handling on real-world testbeds
 - More testcases

<br>

**5. Issue**
 - fix issue : kernel build failure when CONFIG_LOCKDEP=y or CONFIG_EXMEM=n (v1.2.1, thanks to Ravi Shankar)
 - functionality coverage : Even though a version of BIOS and/or CXL device does not provide DVSEC ID info, the patch allows listing CXL device information and node grouping. (v1.2.2, thanks to Wu Chanco)
