daxctl-offline-memory(1)
========================

NAME
----
daxctl-offline-memory - Offline the memory for a device that is in system-ram mode

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'daxctl offline-memory' <dax0.0> [<dax1.0>...<daxY.Z>] [<options>]

EXAMPLES
--------

* Reconfigure dax0.0 to system-ram mode
----
# daxctl reconfigure-device --mode=system-ram --human dax0.0
{
  "chardev":"dax0.0",
  "size":"7.87 GiB (8.45 GB)",
  "target_node":2,
  "mode":"system-ram"
}
----

* Offline the memory
----
# daxctl offline-memory dax0.0
dax0.0: 62 sections offlined
offlined memory for 1 device
----

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Offline the memory sections associated with a device that has been converted
to the system-ram mode. If one or more blocks are already offline, attempt to
offline the remaining blocks. If all blocks were already offline, print a
message and return success without actually doing anything.

This is complementary to the 'daxctl-online-memory' command, and may be used
when it is wished to offline the memory sections, but not convert the device
back to 'devdax' mode.

OPTIONS
-------
-r::
--region=::
	Restrict the operation to devices belonging to the specified region(s).
	A device-dax region is a contiguous range of memory that hosts one or
	more /dev/daxX.Y devices, where X is the region id and Y is the device
	instance id.

-u::
--human::
	By default the command will output machine-friendly raw-integer
	data. Instead, with this flag, numbers representing storage size
	will be formatted as human readable strings with units, other
	fields are converted to hexadecimal strings.

-v::
--verbose::
	Emit more debug messages
