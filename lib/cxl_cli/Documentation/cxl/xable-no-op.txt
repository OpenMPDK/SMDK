Given any enable or disable command, if the operation is a no-op due to the
current state of a target (i.e. already enabled or disabled), it is still
considered successful when executed even if no actual operation is performed.
The target can be a bus, decoder, memdev, or region. The operation will still
succeed, and report the number of bus/decoder/memdev/region operated on, even
if the operation is a no-op.
