NAME
----
libcxl - A library to interact with CXL devices through sysfs(5)
and ioctl(2) interfaces

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
#include <cxl/libcxl.h>
cc ... -lcxl

DESCRIPTION
-----------
libcxl provides interfaces to interact with CXL devices in Linux, using sysfs
interfaces for most kernel interactions, and the ioctl() interface for command
submission.

The starting point for all library interfaces is a 'cxl_ctx' object,
returned by linklibcxl:cxl_new[3]. CXL 'Type 3' memory devices and other
CXL device objects are descendants of the cxl_ctx object, and can be
iterated via an object an iterator API of the form
cxl_<object>_foreach(<parent object>, <object iterator>).

MEMDEVS
-------
The object representing a CXL memory expander (Type 3 device) is 'struct
cxl_memdev'. Library interfaces related to these devices have the prefix
'cxl_memdev_'. These interfaces are mostly associated with sysfs
interactions (unless otherwise noted in their respective documentation
sections). They are typically used to retrieve data published by the
kernel, or to send data or trigger kernel operations for a given device.

=== MEMDEV: Enumeration
----
struct cxl_memdev *cxl_memdev_get_first(struct cxl_ctx *ctx);
struct cxl_memdev *cxl_memdev_get_next(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
struct cxl_ctx *cxl_memdev_get_ctx(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
const char *cxl_memdev_get_host(struct cxl_memdev *memdev)
struct cxl_memdev *cxl_endpoint_get_memdev(struct cxl_endpoint *endpoint);

#define cxl_memdev_foreach(ctx, memdev) \
        for (memdev = cxl_memdev_get_first(ctx); \
             memdev != NULL; \
             memdev = cxl_memdev_get_next(memdev))

----

CXL memdev instances are enumerated from the global library context
'struct cxl_ctx'. By default a memdev only offers a portal to submit
memory device commands, see the port, decoder, and endpoint APIs to
determine what if any CXL Memory Resources are reachable given a
specific memdev.

The host of a memdev is the PCIe Endpoint device that registered its CXL
capabilities with the Linux CXL core.

=== MEMDEV: Attributes
----
int cxl_memdev_get_id(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
unsigned long long cxl_memdev_get_serial(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
const char *cxl_memdev_get_devname(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
int cxl_memdev_get_major(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
int cxl_memdev_get_minor(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
unsigned long long cxl_memdev_get_pmem_size(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
unsigned long long cxl_memdev_get_ram_size(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
const char *cxl_memdev_get_firmware_verison(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
size_t cxl_memdev_get_label_size(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
int cxl_memdev_nvdimm_bridge_active(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
int cxl_memdev_get_numa_node(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
----

A memdev is given a kernel device name of the form "mem%d" where an id
(cxl_memdev_get_id()) is dynamically allocated as devices are
discovered. Note that there are no guarantees that ids / kernel device
names for memdevs are stable from one boot to the next, devices are
enumerated asynchronously. If a stable identifier is use
cxl_memdev_get_serial() which returns a value according to the 'Device
Serial Number Extended Capability' in the PCIe 5.0 Base Specification.

The character device node for command submission can be found by default
at /dev/cxl/mem%d, or created with a major / minor returned from
cxl_memdev_get_{major,minor}().

The 'pmem_size' and 'ram_size' attributes return the current
provisioning of DPA (Device Physical Address / local capacity) in the
device.

cxl_memdev_get_numa_node() returns the affinitized CPU node number if
available or -1 otherwise.

=== MEMDEV: Control
----
int cxl_memdev_disable_invalidate(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
int cxl_memdev_enable(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
----
When a memory device is disabled it unregisters its associated endpoints
and potentially intervening switch ports if there are no other memdevs
pinning that port active. That means that any existing port objects that
the library has previously returned are in valid and need to be re-read.
Callers must be careful to re-retrieve port objects after
cxl_memdev_disable_invalidate(). Any usage of a previously obtained port
object after a cxl_memdev_disable_invalidate() call is a use-after-free
programming error. It follows that after cxl_memdev_enable() new ports
may appear in the topology that were not previously enumerable.

NOTE: cxl_memdev_disable_invalidate() will force disable the memdev
regardless of whether the memory provided by the device is in active use
by the operating system. Callers take responisbility for assuring that
it is safe to disable the memory device. Otherwise, this call can be as
destructive as ripping a DIMM out of a running system. Like all other
libcxl calls that mutate the system state or divulge security sensitive
information this call requires root / CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

=== MEMDEV: Commands
----
struct cxl_cmd *cxl_cmd_new_raw(struct cxl_memdev *memdev, int opcode);
struct cxl_cmd *cxl_cmd_new_identify(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
struct cxl_cmd *cxl_cmd_new_get_health_info(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
struct cxl_cmd *cxl_cmd_new_read_label(struct cxl_memdev *memdev,
					unsigned int offset, unsigned int length);
struct cxl_cmd *cxl_cmd_new_write_label(struct cxl_memdev *memdev, void *buf,
					unsigned int offset, unsigned int length);
int cxl_memdev_zero_label(struct cxl_memdev *memdev, size_t length,
			  size_t offset);
int cxl_memdev_read_label(struct cxl_memdev *memdev, void *buf, size_t length,
			  size_t offset);
int cxl_memdev_write_label(struct cxl_memdev *memdev, void *buf, size_t length,
			   size_t offset);
struct cxl_cmd *cxl_cmd_new_get_partition(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
struct cxl_cmd *cxl_cmd_new_set_partition(struct cxl_memdev *memdev,
					  unsigned long long volatile_size);

----

A 'cxl_cmd' is a reference counted object which is used to perform 'Mailbox'
commands as described in the CXL Specification. A 'cxl_cmd' object is tied to a
'cxl_memdev'. Associated library interfaces have the prefix 'cxl_cmd_'. Within
this sub-class of interfaces, there are:

 * 'cxl_cmd_new_*()' interfaces that allocate a new cxl_cmd object for a given
   command type targeted at a given memdev. As part of the command
   instantiation process the library validates that the command is
   supported by the memory device, otherwise it returns NULL to indicate
   'no support'. The libcxl command id is translated by the kernel into
   a CXL standard opcode. See the potential command ids in
   /usr/include/linux/cxl_mem.h.

 * 'cxl_cmd_<name>_set_<field>' interfaces that set specific fields in a cxl_cmd

 * 'cxl_cmd_submit' which submits the command via ioctl()

 * 'cxl_cmd_<name>_get_<field>' interfaces that get specific fields out of the
   command response

 * 'cxl_cmd_get_*' interfaces to get general command related information.

cxl_cmd_new_raw() supports so called 'RAW' commands where the command id
is 'RAW' and it carries an unmodified CXL memory device command payload
associated with the 'opcode' argument. Given the kernel does minimal
input validation on these commands typically raw commands are not
supported by the kernel outside debug build scenarios. libcxl is limited
to supporting commands that appear in the CXL standard / public
specifications.

cxl_memdev{read,write,zero}_label() are helpers for marshaling multiple
label access commands over an arbitrary extent of the device's label
area.

cxl_cmd_partition_set_mode() supports selecting NEXTBOOT or IMMEDIATE
mode. When CXL_SETPART_IMMEDIATE mode is set, it is the caller’s
responsibility to avoid immediate changes to partitioning when the
device is in use. When CXL_SETPART_NEXTBOOT mode is set, the change
in partitioning shall become the “next” configuration, to become
active on the next device reset.

BUSES
-----
The CXL Memory space is CPU and Device coherent. The address ranges that
support coherent access are described by platform firmware and
communicated to the operating system via a CXL root object 'struct
cxl_bus'.

=== BUS: Enumeration
----
struct cxl_bus *cxl_bus_get_first(struct cxl_ctx *ctx);
struct cxl_bus *cxl_bus_get_next(struct cxl_bus *bus);
struct cxl_ctx *cxl_bus_get_ctx(struct cxl_bus *bus);
struct cxl_bus *cxl_memdev_get_bus(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
struct cxl_bus *cxl_port_get_bus(struct cxl_port *port);
struct cxl_bus *cxl_endpoint_get_bus(struct cxl_endpoint *endpoint);

#define cxl_bus_foreach(ctx, bus)                                           \
       for (bus = cxl_bus_get_first(ctx); bus != NULL;                      \
            bus = cxl_bus_get_next(bus))
----
When a memdev is active it has established a CXL port hierarchy between
itself and the root of its associated CXL topology. The
cxl_{memdev,endpoint}_get_bus() helpers walk that topology to retrieve
the associated bus object.

=== BUS: Attributes
----
const char *cxl_bus_get_provider(struct cxl_bus *bus);
const char *cxl_bus_get_devname(struct cxl_bus *bus);
int cxl_bus_get_id(struct cxl_bus *bus);
----

The provider name of a bus is a persistent name that is independent of
discovery order. The possible provider names are 'ACPI.CXL' and
'cxl_test'. The devname and id attributes, like other objects, are just
the kernel device names that are subject to change based on discovery
order.

=== BUS: Control
----
int cxl_bus_disable_invalidate(struct cxl_bus *bus);
----

An entire CXL topology can be torn down with this API. Like other
_invalidate APIs callers must assume that all library objects have been
freed. This one goes one step further and also frees the @bus argument.
This may crash the system and is only useful in kernel driver
development scenarios.


PORTS
-----
CXL ports track the PCIe hierarchy between a platform firmware CXL root
object, through CXL / PCIe Host Bridges, CXL / PCIe Root Ports, and CXL
/ PCIe Switch Ports.

=== PORT: Enumeration
----
struct cxl_port *cxl_bus_get_port(struct cxl_bus *bus);
struct cxl_port *cxl_port_get_first(struct cxl_port *parent);
struct cxl_port *cxl_port_get_next(struct cxl_port *port);
struct cxl_port *cxl_port_get_parent(struct cxl_port *port);
struct cxl_ctx *cxl_port_get_ctx(struct cxl_port *port);
const char *cxl_port_get_host(struct cxl_port *port);
struct cxl_port *cxl_decoder_get_port(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
struct cxl_port *cxl_port_get_next_all(struct cxl_port *port,
                                       const struct cxl_port *top);
struct cxl_port *cxl_dport_get_port(struct cxl_dport *dport);

#define cxl_port_foreach(parent, port)                                      \
       for (port = cxl_port_get_first(parent); port != NULL;                \
            port = cxl_port_get_next(port))

#define cxl_port_foreach_all(top, port)                                        \
       for (port = cxl_port_get_first(top); port != NULL;                     \
            port = cxl_port_get_next_all(port, top))


----
A bus object encapsulates a CXL port object. Use cxl_bus_get_port() to
use generic port APIs on root objects.

Ports are hierarchical. All but the a root object have another CXL port
as a parent object retrievable via cxl_port_get_parent().

The root port of a hiearchy can be retrieved via any port instance in
that hierarchy via cxl_port_get_bus().

The host of a port is the corresponding device name of the PCIe Root
Port, or Switch Upstream Port with CXL capabilities.

The cxl_port_foreach_all() helper does a depth first iteration of all
ports beneath the 'top' port argument.

=== PORT: Control
---
int cxl_port_disable_invalidate(struct cxl_port *port);
int cxl_port_enable(struct cxl_port *port);
---
cxl_port_disable_invalidate() is a violent operation that disables
entire sub-tree of CXL Memory Device and Ports, only use it for test /
debug scenarios, or ensuring that all impacted devices are deactivated
first.

=== PORT: Attributes
----
const char *cxl_port_get_devname(struct cxl_port *port);
int cxl_port_get_id(struct cxl_port *port);
int cxl_port_is_enabled(struct cxl_port *port);
bool cxl_port_is_root(struct cxl_port *port);
bool cxl_port_is_switch(struct cxl_port *port);
bool cxl_port_is_endpoint(struct cxl_port *port);
int cxl_port_get_depth(struct cxl_port *port);
bool cxl_port_hosts_memdev(struct cxl_port *port, struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
int cxl_port_get_nr_dports(struct cxl_port *port);
----
The port type is communicated via cxl_port_is_<type>(). An 'enabled' port
is one that has succeeded in discovering the CXL component registers in
the host device and has enumerated its downstream ports. In order for a
memdev to be enabled for CXL memory operation all CXL ports in its
ancestry must also be enabled including a root port, an arbitrary number
of intervening switch ports, and a terminal endpoint port.

cxl_port_hosts_memdev() returns true if the port's host appears in the
memdev host's device topology ancestry.

==== DPORTS
A CXL dport object represents a CXL / PCIe Switch Downstream Port, or a
CXL / PCIe host bridge.

===== DPORT: Enumeration
----
struct cxl_dport *cxl_dport_get_first(struct cxl_port *port);
struct cxl_dport *cxl_dport_get_next(struct cxl_dport *dport);
struct cxl_dport *cxl_port_get_dport_by_memdev(struct cxl_port *port,
                                               struct cxl_memdev *memdev);

#define cxl_dport_foreach(port, dport)                                     \
       for (dport = cxl_dport_get_first(port); dport != NULL;              \
            dport = cxl_dport_get_next(dport))
----

===== DPORT: Attributes
----
const char *cxl_dport_get_devname(struct cxl_dport *dport);
const char *cxl_dport_get_physical_node(struct cxl_dport *dport);
int cxl_dport_get_id(struct cxl_dport *dport);
bool cxl_dport_maps_memdev(struct cxl_dport *dport, struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
----
The id of a dport is the hardware idenfifier used by an upstream port to
reference a downstream port. The physical node of a dport is only
available for platform firmware defined downstream ports and alias the
companion object, like a PCI host bridge, in the PCI device hierarchy.

The cxl_dport_maps_memdev() helper checks if a dport is an ancestor of a
given memdev.

ENDPOINTS
---------
CXL endpoint objects encapsulate the set of host-managed device-memory
(HDM) decoders in a physical memory device. The endpoint is the last hop
in a decoder chain that translate SPA to DPA (system-physical-address to
device-local-physical-address).

=== ENDPOINT: Enumeration
----
struct cxl_endpoint *cxl_endpoint_get_first(struct cxl_port *parent);
struct cxl_endpoint *cxl_endpoint_get_next(struct cxl_endpoint *endpoint);
struct cxl_ctx *cxl_endpoint_get_ctx(struct cxl_endpoint *endpoint);
struct cxl_port *cxl_endpoint_get_parent(struct cxl_endpoint *endpoint);
struct cxl_port *cxl_endpoint_get_port(struct cxl_endpoint *endpoint);
const char *cxl_endpoint_get_host(struct cxl_endpoint *endpoint);
struct cxl_endpoint *cxl_memdev_get_endpoint(struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
struct cxl_endpoint *cxl_port_to_endpoint(struct cxl_port *port);

#define cxl_endpoint_foreach(port, endpoint)                                 \
       for (endpoint = cxl_endpoint_get_first(port); endpoint != NULL;       \
            endpoint = cxl_endpoint_get_next(endpoint))
----

=== ENDPOINT: Attributes
----
const char *cxl_endpoint_get_devname(struct cxl_endpoint *endpoint);
int cxl_endpoint_get_id(struct cxl_endpoint *endpoint);
int cxl_endpoint_is_enabled(struct cxl_endpoint *endpoint);
----

DECODERS
--------
Decoder objects are associated with the "HDM Decoder Capability"
published in Port devices and CXL capable PCIe endpoints. The kernel
additionally models platform firmware described CXL memory ranges (like
the ACPI CEDT.CFMWS) as static decoder objects. They route System
Physical Addresses through a port topology to an endpoint decoder that
does the final translation from SPA to DPA (system-physical-address to
device-local-physical-address).

=== DECODER: Enumeration
----
struct cxl_decoder *cxl_decoder_get_first(struct cxl_port *port);
struct cxl_decoder *cxl_decoder_get_next(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
struct cxl_ctx *cxl_decoder_get_ctx(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
struct cxl_decoder *cxl_target_get_decoder(struct cxl_target *target);

#define cxl_decoder_foreach(port, decoder)                                  \
       for (decoder = cxl_decoder_get_first(port); decoder != NULL;         \
            decoder = cxl_decoder_get_next(decoder))
----
The definition of a CXL port in libcxl is an object that hosts one or
more CXL decoder objects.

=== DECODER: Attributes
----
unsigned long long cxl_decoder_get_resource(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
unsigned long long cxl_decoder_get_size(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
unsigned long long cxl_decoder_get_dpa_resource(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
unsigned long long cxl_decoder_get_dpa_size(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
int cxl_decoder_set_dpa_size(struct cxl_decoder *decoder, unsigned long long size);
const char *cxl_decoder_get_devname(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
int cxl_decoder_get_id(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
int cxl_decoder_get_nr_targets(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
struct cxl_region *cxl_decoder_get_region(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);

enum cxl_decoder_target_type {
       CXL_DECODER_TTYPE_UNKNOWN,
       CXL_DECODER_TTYPE_EXPANDER,
       CXL_DECODER_TTYPE_ACCELERATOR,
};

cxl_decoder_get_target_type(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);

enum cxl_decoder_mode {
	CXL_DECODER_MODE_NONE,
	CXL_DECODER_MODE_MIXED,
	CXL_DECODER_MODE_PMEM,
	CXL_DECODER_MODE_RAM,
};
enum cxl_decoder_mode cxl_decoder_get_mode(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
int cxl_decoder_set_mode(struct cxl_decoder *decoder, enum cxl_decoder_mode mode);

bool cxl_decoder_is_pmem_capable(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
bool cxl_decoder_is_volatile_capable(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
bool cxl_decoder_is_mem_capable(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
bool cxl_decoder_is_accelmem_capable(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
bool cxl_decoder_is_locked(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
----
The kernel protects the enumeration of the physical address layout of
the system. Without CAP_SYS_ADMIN cxl_decoder_get_resource() returns
ULLONG_MAX to indicate that the address information was not retrievable.
Otherwise, cxl_decoder_get_resource() returns the currently programmed
value of the base of the decoder's decode range. A zero-sized decoder
indicates a disabled decoder.

Root level decoders only support limited set of memory types in their
address range. The cxl_decoder_is_<memtype>_capable() helpers identify
what is supported. Switch level decoders, in contrast are capable of
routing any memory type, i.e. they just forward along the memory type
support from their parent port. Endpoint decoders follow the
capabilities of their host memory device.

The capabilities of a decoder are not to be confused with their type /
mode.  The type ultimately depends on the endpoint. For example an
accelerator requires all decoders in its ancestry to be set to
CXL_DECODER_TTYPE_ACCELERATOR, and conversely plain memory expander
devices require CXL_DECODER_TTYPE_EXPANDER.

Platform firmware may setup the CXL decode hierarchy before the OS
boots, and may additionally require that the OS not change the decode
settings. This property is indicated by the cxl_decoder_is_locked() API.

When a decoder is associated with a region cxl_decoder_get_region()
returns that region object. Note that it is only applicable to switch
and endpoint decoders as root decoders have a 1:N relationship with
regions.  Use cxl_region_foreach() for the similar functionality for
root decoders.

==== TARGETS
A root or switch level decoder takes an SPA (system-physical-address) as
input and routes it to a downstream port. Which downstream port depends
on the downstream port's position in the interleave. A 'struct
cxl_target' object represents the properties of a given downstream port
relative to its interleave configuration.

===== TARGET: Enumeration
----
struct cxl_target *cxl_decoder_get_target_by_memdev(struct cxl_decoder *decoder,
                                                   struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
struct cxl_target *
cxl_decoder_get_target_by_position(struct cxl_decoder *decoder, int position);
struct cxl_target *cxl_target_get_first(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
struct cxl_target *cxl_target_get_next(struct cxl_target *target);

#define cxl_target_foreach(decoder, target)                                   \
       for (target = cxl_target_get_first(decoder); target != NULL;           \
            target = cxl_target_get_next(target))
----
Target objects can only be enumerated if the decoder has been
configured, for switch decoders. For root decoders they are always
available since the root decoder target mapping is static. The
cxl_decoder_get_target_by_memdev() helper walks the topology to validate
if the given memory device is capable of receiving cycles from this
upstream decoder. It does not validate if the memory device is currently
configured to participate in that decode.

===== TARGET: Attributes
----
int cxl_target_get_position(struct cxl_target *target);
unsigned long cxl_target_get_id(struct cxl_target *target);
const char *cxl_target_get_devname(struct cxl_target *target);
bool cxl_target_maps_memdev(struct cxl_target *target,
                           struct cxl_memdev *memdev);
const char *cxl_target_get_physical_node(struct cxl_target *target);
----
The position of a decoder along with the interleave granularity dictate
which address in the decoder's resource range map to which port.

The target id is an identifier that the CXL port uses to reference this
downstream port. For CXL / PCIe downstream switch ports the id is
defined by the PCIe Link Capability Port Number field. For root decoders
the id is specified by platform firmware specific mechanism. For
ACPI.CXL defined root ports the id comes from the CEDT.CHBS / ACPI0016
_UID.

The device name of a target is the name of the host device for the
downstream port. For CXL / PCIe downstream ports the devname is
downstream switch port PCI device. For CXL root ports the devname is a
platform firmware object for the host bridge like a ACPI0016 device
instance.

The cxl_target_maps_memdev() helper is the companion of
cxl_decoder_get_target_by_memdev() to determine which downstream ports /
targets are capable of mapping which memdevs.

Some platform firmware implementations define an alias / companion
device to represent the root of a PCI device hierarchy. The
cxl_target_get_physical_node() helper returns the device name of that
companion object in the PCI hierarchy.

==== REGIONS
A CXL region is composed of one or more slices of CXL memdevs, with configurable
interleave settings - both the number of interleave ways, and the interleave
granularity. In terms of hierarchy, it is the child of a CXL root decoder. A root
decoder (recall that this corresponds to an ACPI CEDT.CFMWS 'window'), may have
multiple child regions, but a region is strictly tied to one root decoder.

The slices that compose a region are called mappings. A mapping is a
tuple of 'memdev', 'endpoint decoder', and the 'position'.

===== REGION: Enumeration
----
struct cxl_region *cxl_region_get_first(struct cxl_decoder *decoder);
struct cxl_region *cxl_region_get_next(struct cxl_region *region);

#define cxl_region_foreach(decoder, region)                                    \

	     _region = region ? cxl_region_get_next(region) : NULL;            \
	     region != NULL;                                                   \

A region's resource attribute is the Host Physical Address at which the region's
address space starts. The region's address space is a subset of the parent root
decoder's address space.

The interleave ways is the number of component memdevs participating in the
region.

The interleave granularity depends on the root decoder's granularity, and must
follow the interleave math rules defined in the CXL spec.

Regions have a list of targets 0..N, which are programmed with the name of an
endpoint decoder under each participating memdev.

The 'decode_commit' and 'decode_reset' attributes reserve and free DPA space
on a given memdev by allocating an endpoint decoder, and programming it based
on the region's interleave geometry.
