cxl-disable-bus(1)
===================

NAME
----
cxl-disable-bus - Shutdown an entire tree of CXL devices

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'cxl disable-bus' <root0> [<root1>..<rootN>] [<options>]

For test and debug scenarios, disable a CXL bus and any associated
memory devices from CXL.mem operations.

OPTIONS
-------
-f::
--force::
	DANGEROUS: Override the safety measure that blocks attempts to disable a
	bus if the tool determines a descendent memdev is in active usage.
	Recall that CXL memory ranges might have been established by platform
	firmware and disabling an active device is akin to force removing memory
	from a running system.

--debug::
	If the cxl tool was built with debug disabled, turn on debug
	messages.
