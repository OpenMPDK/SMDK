OPTIONS
-------
-f::
--force::
	DANGEROUS: Override the safety measure that blocks attempts to disable a
	bus if the tool determines a descendent memdev is in active usage.
	Recall that CXL memory ranges might have been established by platform
	firmware and disabling an active device is akin to force removing memory
	from a running system.

--debug::
	If the cxl tool was built with debug disabled, turn on debug
	messages.
