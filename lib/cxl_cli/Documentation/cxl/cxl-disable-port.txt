SYNOPSIS
--------

include::xable-no-op.txt[]

OPTIONS
-------
-e::
--endpoint::
	Toggle from treating the port arguments as Switch Port identifiers to
	Endpoint Port identifiers.

-f::
--force::
	DANGEROUS: Override the safety measure that blocks attempts to disable a
	port if the tool determines a descendent memdev is in active usage.
	Recall that CXL memory ranges might have been established by platform
	firmware and disabling an active device is akin to force removing memory
	from a running system.
