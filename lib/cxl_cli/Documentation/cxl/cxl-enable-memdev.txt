cxl-enable-memdev(1)
====================

NAME
----
cxl-enable-memdev - activate / hot-add a given CXL memdev

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'cxl enable-memdev' <mem0> [<mem1>..<memN>] [<options>]

A memdev typically autoenables at initial device discovery. However, if
it was manually disabled this command can trigger the kernel to activate
it again. This involves detecting the state of the HDM (Host Managed
Device Memory) Decoders and validating that CXL.mem is enabled for each
port in the device's hierarchy.
