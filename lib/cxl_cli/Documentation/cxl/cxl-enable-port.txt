cxl-enable-port(1)
==================

NAME
----
cxl-enable-port - activate / hot-add a given CXL port

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'cxl enable-port' <port0> [<port1>..<portN>] [<options>]

A port typically autoenables at initial device discovery. However, if it
was manually disabled this command can trigger the kernel to activate it
again. This involves detecting the state of the HDM (Host Managed Device
Memory) Decoders and validating that CXL.mem is enabled for each port in
the device's hierarchy.

OPTIONS
-------
-e::
--endpoint::
	Toggle from treating the port arguments as Switch Port identifiers to
	Endpoint Port identifiers.

-m::
--enable-memdevs::
	Try to enable descendant memdevs after enabling the port. Recall that a
	memdev is only enabled after all CXL ports in its device topology
	ancestry are enabled.
