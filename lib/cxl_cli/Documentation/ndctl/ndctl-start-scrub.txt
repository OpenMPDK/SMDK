ndctl-start-scrub(1)
====================

NAME
----
ndctl-start-scrub - start an Address Range Scrub (ARS) operation

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ndctl start-scrub' [<bus-id> <bus-id2> ... <bus-idN>] [<options>]

include::ars-description.txt[]

The kernel provides a sysfs file ('scrub') that when written with the
string "1\n" initiates an ARS operation. The 'ndctl start-scrub'
operation starts an ARS, across all specified buses, and the kernel in
turn proceeds to scrub every persistent memory address region on the
specified buses.

EXAMPLE
-------
Start a scrub on all nvdimm buses in the system. The json listing report
only includes the buses that support ARS operations.
----

# ndctl start-scrub
[
  {
    "provider":"nfit_test.1",
    "dev":"ndbus3",
    "scrub_state":"active"
  },
  {
    "provider":"nfit_test.0",
    "dev":"ndbus2",
    "scrub_state":"active"
  }
]
----

When specifying an individual bus, or if there is only one bus in the
system, the command reports whether ARS support is available.
----
# ndctl start-scrub e820
error starting scrub: Operation not supported
----

OPTIONS
-------
-v::
--verbose::
	Emit debug messages for the ARS start process
