ndctl-load-keys(1)
==================

NAME
----
ndctl-load-keys - load the kek and encrypted passphrases into the keyring

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'ndctl load-keys' [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The 'load-keys' command loads the master key ('kek') and the encrypted
passphrases for all NVDIMMs into the user keyring maintained by the kernel.
The command is expected to be called during initialization and before the
libnvdimm kernel module is loaded, typically from an initrd. This is typically
set up using a modprobe config that calls the command before module load.

NOTE: All key files are expected to be in the format: nvdimm_<id>_hostname +
The `'_`' character is used to delimit the different components in the file name.
Within the hostname, the `'_`' character is allowed since it is the last component
of the file name.

NOTE: This command is typically never called directly by a user.

OPTIONS
-------
-p::
--key-path=::
	Path to where key related files reside. This parameter is optional
	and the default location is {ndctl_keysdir}.

-t::
--tpm-handle=::
	Provide a TPM handle (should be a string such as 0x81000001).
	If the key path ({ndctl_keysdir}) contains a file called tpm.handle
	which contains the handle string, then this option may be left out,
	and the tpm handle will be obtained from the file. If both are present,
	then this option will override (but not overwrite) anything that is
	in the file.
