DESCRIPTION
-----------
A generic DIMM device object, named /dev/nmemX, is registered for each
memory device indicated in the ACPI NFIT table, or other platform NVDIMM
resource discovery mechanism.  The LIBNVDIMM core provides a built-in
driver for these DIMM devices.  The driver is responsible for
determining if the DIMM implements a namespace label area, and
initializing the kernel's in-memory copy of that label data.

The kernel performs runtime modifications of that data when namespace
provisioning actions are taken, and actively blocks userspace from
initiating label data changes while the DIMM is active in any region.
Disabling a DIMM, after all the regions it is a member of have been
disabled, allows userspace to manually update the label data to be
consumed when the DIMM is next enabled.
